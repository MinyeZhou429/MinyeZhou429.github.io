**Title**:

From Genes to Proteins-A Comprehensive RNA Sequencing Approach to Studying Alzheimer's Disease Pathology

**Members and Contributors**:

Lucy Tian, Minye Zhou, Michelle Dai, Evelyn(Sizhu) Jiang, Yushan Xu


**Data type**:

Bulk RNA-Seq data

**Summary**:

Complate workflow of RNA sequencing analysis. It starts from alignment to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.

**Introduction and Rationale**:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder marked by the abnormal buildup of amyloid-β and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, leading to cognitive decline and memory loss. Extensive research, including our study, leverages RNA sequencing to explore AD’s genetic underpinnings, revealing key genes like APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, and risk factors such as the APOEε4 allele. This RNA-seq analysis of AD patients versus controls identifies differentially expressed genes and integrates clustering, protein-protein interactions, and pathway analyses to offer a comprehensive view of the molecular dynamics at play.
