Title: Integrating RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq Data to Infer Gene Regulatory Networks

Summary: Using dual-pipeline approach to build gene regulatory network

Data Type: Bulk-RNA Transcriptomic data and ATAC-Seq data

Tools: Scenic+ pipeline, HOMER, T-Gene

Introduction and rationale:
Gene regulation is a process controlling geneâ€™s expression through many mechanisms. Gene regulation is important for proper cellular function, development, and adaption to different environments. Genes can be regulated at different stages. This project focuses on transcription factor gene regulatory events. How can genes be regulated through transcription factors? How can we use ATAC-Seq and RNA-seq data to infer gene regulatory network?


Method and pipeline:
