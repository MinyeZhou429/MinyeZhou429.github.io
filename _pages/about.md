Hi!I'm Minye Zhou. I graduated from UCSD majored in Bioinformatics in 2022, then I pursued a master's degree in Computational Biology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I recently graduated and I'm actively looking for a research assistant position in Computational Biology field.

My primary research interest is gaining more understanding in disease pathology and mechanisms. I love exloring and I'm open to any project.
