## Welcome! 

My name is Minye Zhou. I graduated from UCSD with a major in Bioinformatics in 2022, then pursued a Master's degree in Computational Biology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Having recently graduated, I am actively seeking a research assistant position in the field of Computational Biology.

My primary research interest is to gain a deeper understanding of disease pathology and mechanisms. I am enthusiastic about exploring new areas and am open to any project.

I specialize in biological data analysis, including bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell sequencing, and flow cytometry data. My skill set includes Python, R, and Java.

Please explore my portfolio and connect with me here. I am eager to share my passion and engage with you!
